    <p>Como preparar la mejor ensalada cesar en simples pasos</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces frozen crispy chicken cutlets</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups frozen bite-sized potato nuggets</li>
        <li>2 ounces parmesan chesse</li>
        <li>1 cup caesar dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon anchovy paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <p><h2>How to Make</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set 2 shelves near the center of the oven. Spray a baking pan with cooking spray; place frozen chicken filets on the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the lower-center shelf until hot and crisp, about 20 minutes, turning filets over halfway through heating time. When cool enough to handle, cut filets into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, and add tater tots in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake on upper-center shelf in the preheated oven until tots are soft and slightly baked, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Spray cooking spray on the bottom of a cup. Smash each tater tot into a flat disk with cup. </li>
        <li>Return to the oven; bake until golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven again, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake again until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk Caesar dressing, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.

        </li>
        <li>Toss together lettuce, chicken, remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper until well combined. Pour half the dressing into salad mix and toss until evenly coated. Add cooled tater tots and toss until well combined.

        </li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle with white balsamic vinegar, and garnish with more Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
